# ðŸŒ¿ HabitApp

A free Android & iOS app designed to help people build better routines.

I've always wanted to create tools that help meâ€”and hopefully othersâ€”handle everyday tasks and challenges. The goal of this app is to support users in building consistent habits and staying focused on what matters most.

The app is being developed using Flutter, which enables cross-platform compatibility. I chose this framework since I donâ€™t currently have access to a Mac for native iOS development. The app is meant to be completely free, and the source code will be shared here.

## âœ¨ Features

The app consists of three main sections:

## ðŸ“… Habit Section

This is the core of the app. Users can schedule habits in different ways: **daily**, **a specific number of times per week**, or on **selected days**. Each habit can include optional notifications, scheduled times, and even a timer for habits that require a specific duration (e.g., *read for 10 minutes*).

1. **Daily habits** â€“ Tasks to be done every single day.  
2. **# times per week** â€“ Habits that need to be done a certain number of times per week, like *walk the dog 3 times a week*.  
3. **Selected days** â€“ Habits scheduled for specific days, like *take medication on Mondays and Thursdays*.

## ðŸ”Š Sounds Section

When focusing on something, I find it helpful to have background sounds that are a bit different from what you usually find on YouTube or streaming platforms. This section provides ambient sounds that many people find useful for concentrationâ€”like rain, wind, birds, ocean waves, water flow, and more.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Section

This section will provide an overview of the user's progress with their habits over time. The goal is to give a clear visual representation of consistency and improvement.
