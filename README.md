# ðŸŒ¿ HabitApp

A free Android & iOS app designed to help people build better routines.

I've always wanted to create tools that help meâ€”and maybe othersâ€”deal with everyday tasks and challenges. The goal of this app is to support users in building consistent habits and staying focused on what matters.

The app is being developed using Flutter, which allows for cross-platform compatibility. I chose this framework since I don't currently have access to a Mac for native iOS development.
